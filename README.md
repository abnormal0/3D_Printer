3D Printer Designing @ June 2019

This is a project I did 1 year ago, which is a 3D printer, I used SolidWorks software to independently design the mechanical structure of the 3D printer, assisted in the design of the printer's motherboard circuit using Altium Designer, and assisted in the use of Clion as a GUI for embedded programming (C++), finally used Repetier-Host to test and print, the results are good.
